## üìö Chapter 1 Summary

### ‚úÖ Exercise 1: Rule-Based Approach with ELIZA  
Explored the foundational rule-based natural language processing system ELIZA by:
- Reading the original [1966 ELIZA paper](https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WEIZENBAUM-1966-ELIZA-A-Computer-Program-For-the-Study-of-Natural-Language-Communication-Between-Man-And-Machine.pdf)
- Walking through the code and implementation from this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/wadetb/eliza?tab=readme-ov-file)

### ‚úÖ Exercise 2: GPT Paper Series  
Studied the evolution of OpenAI's language models by reading:
- [GPT-1](https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf): *Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training*  
- [GPT-2](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf): *Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners*  
- [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165): *Language Models are Few-Shot Learners*  
- [GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774): *GPT-4 Technical Report*  
- [o1](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/): *Learning to Reason with LLMs*

### ‚úÖ Exercise 3: LLM Prompt Engineering and Security  
- Played [**Gandalf**](https://gandalf.lakera.ai/word-blacklist), a prompt injection game to practice breaking LLM restrictions.  
- Ran an experiment on applying emotional stimuli to LLMs to enhance output quality: [Emotional-stimuli-experiment.ipynb](Emotional-stimuli-experiment.ipynb)
